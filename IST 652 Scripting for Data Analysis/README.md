# IST 652: Scripting for Data Analysis
Analyzing company attrition

## Project Description
Led a comprehensive analysis on employee attrition using a Kaggle HR analytics dataset. Utilized Python in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for data cleaning and preprocessing, tackling duplicates and missing values. Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover key retention factors such as age, travel frequency, and performance. Employed pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and numpy for data manipulation and visualization. Findings highlighted higher attrition among younger employees and frequent travelers, while top performers showed strong retention. Developed a predictive model with 82.65% accuracy to identify at-risk employees, resulting in actionable recommendations to reduce turnover, focusing on support for younger staff and travel policy adjustments.
