## Description
Embarking on the Master of Science in Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University, my academic journey has been both challenging and enriching. Through a series of rigorous courses, such as IST 659: Data Administration Concepts & Management, IST 707: Applied Machine Learning, IST 652: Scripting for Data Analysis, and IST 664: Natural Language Processing, I've mastered SQL, R programming, Python, and the analysis of human language data. This diverse skill set, refined through various projects, prepares me to address real-world data-driven challenges.

My portfolio demonstrates my proficiency in data collection and analysis, generating actionable insights, applying visualization and predictive models, and effectively communicating findings to a wide audience, all while maintaining ethical standards in data use and model evaluation. As I anticipate my graduation in the Spring of 2024, I am eager to apply and share the insights and skills gained from my studies in applied data science.
