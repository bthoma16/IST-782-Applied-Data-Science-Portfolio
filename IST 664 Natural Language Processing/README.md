# IST 664: Natural Language Processing
Conducting sentiment analysis on movie reviews

## Project Description
Developed a sophisticated text classification model to discern sentiments in movie reviews, leveraging Python and Sci-Kit Learn. Managed a dataset of 156,060 phrases from a Kaggle competition, employing advanced preprocessing and feature selection methods such as bag of words and bigrams. Extensive testing across various classifiers, including Na√Øve Bayes and logistic regression, led to a notable enhancement in classification accuracy by optimizing feature sets. Results highlighted the critical role of preprocessing in boosting model accuracy. Notably, Logistic Regression and Linear SVC with the SL + LIWC feature set achieved the highest performance, reaching 59% accuracy, surpassing the unigram baseline of 55%.
