# IST 707: Applied Machine Learning
Conducting student grade prediction

## Project Description
Forecasted academic risks among high school students using data mining. Processed a Kaggle dataset with 395 records and developed predictive models including decision trees, logistic regression, k-NN, SVM, and random forests. The final random forest model yielded a 99.28% accuracy rate in pinpointing at-risk students, offering valuable data for preemptive educational support. Key factors impacting final grades were identified: failures, freetime, fedu, dalc, walc, schoolsup, absences, age, famrel, and famsize.
